# 🌙 Automatic Night Lamp using LDR, Transistor, and Solar Panel



---

## 📝 Description

This project presents an **energy-efficient automatic lighting system** that uses an **LDR**, **transistor**, and **relay** to control an LED lamp based on ambient light. A **solar panel** charges a **battery** during the day, enabling the lamp to operate independently at night without relying on the electrical grid.

An **Arduino Uno** enhances functionality by reading LDR values and controlling the system accordingly. It allows for:

- Automatic switching based on ambient light  
- Adjustable brightness (PWM)  
- Motion detection (optional)  
- Timed lighting functionality  

This eco-friendly and cost-effective solution is ideal for **sustainable off-grid lighting**, minimizing energy consumption and maximizing automation.
